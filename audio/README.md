# Audio Firmware

This directory contains the FX2 audio firmware for the HDMI2USB project. It uses
the Open Source fx2lib, a free reimplementation of the Cypress support library.

The firmware is responsible for transporting the audio data off of the FPGA. It
does this by enumerating as a USB Audio Class device; a standard way of
interfacing devices such as microphones to a host. Linux, Windows and OS X all
include support out of the box for reading taking to such devices.

# Building

The firmware uses the Open Source fx2lib, which will be downloaded as part of
the build process.

The build process requires git, make and SDCC. SDCC, the Small Device C
Compiler, is packaged in Debian and derivatives such as Ubuntu, as well as
Fedora:

    sudo apt-get install sdcc
    sudo yum install sdcc

There are three firmware versions included in this directory:

 * out - an audio playback device for implementing a loopback device using two
         FX2 miniboards (only supports FX2 miniboard)
 * fifo - an audio source that reads from the FIFO to send over USB
 * in - an audio source that generates a constant tone

Each can be compied using make. Currently only one can be built at a time and
all artifacts of any perviously built versions must be removed first (Fixme!)

    make BOARD=fx2miniboard FIRMWARE=out
    make BOARD=fx2miniboard FIRMWARE=fifo
    make BOARD=fx2miniboard FIRMWARE=in

and can be cleaned using

    make BOARD=fx2miniboard FIRMWARE=out clean
    make BOARD=fx2miniboard FIRMWARE=fifo clean
    make BOARD=fx2miniboard FIRMWARE=in clean

`load` works in the same way.

# Serial

 * Baud rate of 115200
 * Serial device /dev/ttyUSB0 (default on linux)
 * Connections
  - RXD -> PD3
  - GND -> GND

# FIFO

The FIFO setup currently does not work. It uses two FX2 miniboards - one with
the `fifo` firmware and one with the `out` firmware.

Connections are as follows (`out` on the left and `fifo` on the right):

 - PA1 (FULL\_FLAG) <- CTL1
 - PA2 (EMPTY\_FLAG) <- CTL2
 - PA4 (SLWR) -> RDY1
 - PA4 (FIFOADD0) -> PA4
 - PA5 (FIFOADD1) -> PA5
 - PA6 (PKTEND) -> PA6
 - IOB (FD[7:0]) -> IOB
 - PD1 (IFCLK) -> IFCLK
 - GND -> GND
